# Explaning block_constructor.py file

## Importing Necessary Modules:
- We import the csv module to handle CSV file parsing.
- We import defaultdict from the collections module to create a default dictionary, which will be used to represent the graph of transactions.

## Transaction Class:
- This class represents a transaction. It has attributes for transaction ID (txid), fee, weight, and a list of parent transaction IDs (parents).

## Parsing Mempool CSV File:
- This function reads the mempool.csv file and parses its contents to create Transaction objects. It returns a dictionary where keys are transaction IDs and values are Transaction objects.

## Creating Graph Representation:
- This function creates a graph representation of the transactions and their dependencies. It uses a defaultdict to create a list of child transactions for each parent transaction.

## Selecting Transactions for Block:
- This function performs a depth-first search (DFS) on the graph to select transactions for inclusion in the block. It ensures that transactions are selected in an order that maximizes fees while respecting weight constraints and dependencies.

## Main Function:
- The main function reads the mempool.csv file, constructs the graph, selects transactions for the block, calculates the total fee, and writes the selected transactions to a block.txt file. It ensures that the main code block is only executed when the script is run directly.
